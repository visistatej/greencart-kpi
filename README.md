GreenCart Logistics - Delivery Simulation & KPI Dashboard

A Full-Stack Project for Purple Merit Technologies Assessment
This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application developed as part of the Full-Stack Developer Assessment for Purple Merit Technologies. It serves as an internal tool for a fictional eco-friendly delivery company, GreenCart Logistics. The application allows managers to run complex delivery simulations, visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on an interactive dashboard, and manage the core data of the operation: drivers, routes, and orders.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive KPI Dashboard: Dynamically visualizes crucial metrics like Total Profit and Efficiency Score. Includes interactive charts from Recharts for on-time vs. late deliveries and fuel cost breakdowns.

Dynamic Simulation Engine: Allows managers to input parameters like the number of available drivers and maximum work hours to run "what-if" scenarios and see their immediate impact on KPIs.

Full CRUD Functionality: Provides complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for Drivers, Routes, and Orders through intuitive, modal-based forms.

Secure JWT Authentication: The backend is secured with JSON Web Tokens, ensuring that only authenticated managers can access the dashboard and its features.

Responsive UI: The user interface is designed to be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
